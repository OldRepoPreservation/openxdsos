                      OpenExchange - OpenXDS 
 

  What is it? 
  -----------
  
  OpenExchange is a Charter project under Open Health Tools (openhealthtools.org)
  providing standards based core infrastructure to exchange patient health 
  information in a secure and timely manner, to advance the quality, safety 
  and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The OpenExchange platform is a critical
  element of HIE infrastructure that provides clinicians and other members of 
  the healthcare community with the right information at the right time by 
  making patient information available across organizational boundaries. It 
  facilitates and streamlines the sharing of patient information throughout 
  an HIE community.  

  OpenExchange consists of open source projects that use Integrating the 
  Healthcare Enterprise (IHE.net) profiles as the set of fundamental 
  requirements. The core set of open source projects under OpenExchange 
  include OpenPIXPDQ, OpenXDS (with XCA), OpenATNA and OpenAuth.  
 
  OpenXDS, as a child project of OpenExchange, implements the Document 
  Repository and Document Registry actors of the Cross-Enterprise Document 
  Sharing (XDS) profile and the Initiating Gateway and Responding Gateway
  actors of the Cross Community Access (XCA)profile specified by IHE.
